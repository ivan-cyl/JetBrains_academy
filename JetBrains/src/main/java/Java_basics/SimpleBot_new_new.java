         * Description
         * Now you will teach your bot to count. It's going to become an expert in numbers!
         *
         * Objective
         * In this stage, you will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number users enter.
         *
         * Example
         * The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
         *
         * Example 1: a dialogue with the new version of the bot
         *
         * Hello! My name is Aid.
         * I was created in 2020.
         * Please, remind me your name.
         * > Max
         * What a great name you have, Max!
         * Let me guess your age.
         * Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
         * > 1
         * > 2
         * > 1
         * Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
         * Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
         * > 5
         * 0!
         * 1!
         * 2!
         * 3!
         * 4!
         * 5!
         * Completed, have a nice day!
         * Note: each number starts with a new line, and after a number, the bot should print the exclamation mark.
         *
         * Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text if you want, but be especially careful when counting numbers.
