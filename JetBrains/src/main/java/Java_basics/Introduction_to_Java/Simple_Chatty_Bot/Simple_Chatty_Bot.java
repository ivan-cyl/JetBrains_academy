         * Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.
         * In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.
         * For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!
         * Your program should print the following lines:
         *
         * Hello! My name is {botName}.
         * I was created in {birthYear}.
